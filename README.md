# Reanalyze AML 2019

This repository will contain scripts to reanalyze the single-cell RNA-seq data on AML patient samples that was originally published in 2019 ([van Galen et al, Cell 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30827681/)). The analyses here mostly pertain to assessing gene expression in normal and malignant bone marrow cell types.

With the original publication, the raw data was deposited on GEO (accession [GSE116256](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116256)); you don't need this for any of the analysis described here. The code by Volker Hovestadt is found on the Bernstein lab [aml2019](https://github.com/BernsteinLab/aml2019) repository.
